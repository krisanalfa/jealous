        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>This is support pages for Bono, Norm, and Naked. They who found problem, may ask here for some help.</p>
        <p>
            We know it's hard for you to follow our progress.
            Each revision of Bono, Norm, and Naked (BNN) makes you confuse about what's new and what has been deprecated.
            <br/>
            What should you use, or what shouldn't you do.
            BNN is full of magic, but you should understand the consequence
            behind that magic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every developer may find something that cannot be solved via mainstream way.
            Like how to use, what's the feature, how to extend, how to make a component, etc.
            <br/>
            At the end, we will make a note (based on what you ask here) to write our documentation for BNN itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            We realize, that BNN is far enough from it's stable release. Then we want to know if we are create
            something that can solve your problem without any other problem.
            <br/>
            If you think that we miss some feature, you can ask them over here.
            Or maybe you find a bug or security issue, you also can write them here.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, we want to make sure, you ask every question inside your head about BNN.
            I hope we can solve your problem.
            Happy code.
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>Regards,</p>
